In-depth Characterization and Analysis of Mutational Signatures (ICAMS)

## Purpose

Analysis and visualization of experimentally elucidated mutational
signatures – the kind of analysis and visualization in Boot et al.,
“In-depth characterization of the cisplatin mutational signature in
human cell lines and in esophageal and liver tumors”, Genome Research
2018, <http://doi.org/10.1101/gr.230219.117>. “ICAMS” stands for
In-depth Characterization and Analysis of Mutational Signatures. ICAMS
has functions to read in variant call files (VCFs) and to collate the
corresponding catalogs of mutational spectra and to analyze and plot
catalogs of mutational spectra and signatures. Handles both
“counts-based” and “density-based” catalogs of mutational spectra or
signatures.

## Installation

Install ICAMS v2.0.1 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with the R
command
line:

``` r
devtools::install_github("steverozen/ICAMS", ref = "v2.0.1")
```
