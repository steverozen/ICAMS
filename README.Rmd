In-depth Characterization and Analysis of Mutational Signatures ('ICAMS')

## Purpose

Analysis and visualization of experimentally elucidated mutational
    signatures -- the kind of analysis and visualization in Boot et al.,
    "In-depth characterization of the cisplatin mutational signature in 
    human cell lines and in esophageal and liver tumors", Genome Research 2018, 
    <https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.230219.117> and
    "Characterization of colibactin-associated mutational signature in an 
    Asian oral squamous cell carcinoma and in other mucosal tumor types",
    Genome Research 2020 <https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.255620.119>.
    'ICAMS' stands for In-depth Characterization 
    and Analysis of Mutational Signatures. 'ICAMS' has functions to read in 
    variant call files (VCFs) and to collate the corresponding catalogs of 
    mutational spectra and to analyze and plot catalogs of mutational spectra
    and signatures. Handles both "counts-based" and "density-based" catalogs
    of mutational spectra or signatures.

## Installation

### Get the stable version

*IMPORTANT* Install the
[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) dependencies first:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("BSgenome")
```

This may be slow; please be patient.

Afterwards, install the stable version of ICAMS from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with the R command line:

``` r
install.packages("ICAMS")
```

### Get the development version

To use new features in the development version,
you can install ICAMS from the master branch on [GitHub](https://github.com/),
which may not be stable:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github(repo = "steverozen/ICAMS", ref = "master")
```

Alternatively, you can download the [package source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steverozen/ICAMS/master/data-raw/source-file/ICAMS_2.3.6.tar.gz) of recent *stable development* version of ICAMS to your computer, then do:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_local(path = "path-to-package-source-file-on-your-computer")
```

## Frequently asked questions

#### How to do normalization for "counts-based" catalogs of mutational spectra or signatures to account for differing abundances of the source sequence of the mutations?

You can use *exported* function `TransformCatalog` in ICAMS to normalize the
data. Please refer to the documentation and example of `TransformCatalog` for
more details.
