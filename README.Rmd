ICAMS: In-depth Characterization and Analysis of Mutational Signatures

## Purpose

A toolkit for analysis and visualization of experimentally elucidated mutational signatures -- 
the kind of analysis and visualization presented in Boot et al., ``In-depth characterization of the cisplatin 
mutational signature in human cell lines and in esophageal and liver tumors'', 
2018, https://genome.cshlp.org/content/28/5/654.short. This package has functions to read in variant call files and to collate 
the corresponding catalogs of mutational spectra and to analyze and plot catalogs of mutational spectra and signatures.

## Installation

You can install the **development** version of ICAMS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("steverozen/ICAMS")
```

## Reference manual

You can download the PDF manual from: https://github.com/steverozen/ICAMS/blob/master/data-raw/ICAMS_2.0.0.9008.pdf
