SplitListOfVCFs(
  list.of.vcfs,
  max.vaf.diff = 0.02,
  suppress.discarded.variants.warnings = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{list.of.vcfs}{List of VCFs as in-memory data.frames.}

\item{max.vaf.diff}{The maximum difference of VAF, default value is 0.02. If
the absolute difference of VAFs for adjacent SBSs is bigger than
\code{max.vaf.diff}, then these adjacent SBSs are likely to be "merely"
asynchronous single base mutations, opposed to a simultaneous doublet
mutation or variants involving more than two consecutive bases.}

\item{suppress.discarded.variants.warnings}{Logical. Whether to suppress
warning messages showing information about the discarded variants. Default
is TRUE.}

\section{Value}{
 A list containing the following objects:
\itemize{
\item \code{SBS}: List of VCFs with only single base substitutions.
\item \code{DBS}: List of VCFs with only doublet base substitutions as called
by Mutect.
\item \code{ID}: List of VCFs with only small insertions and deletions.
\item \code{discarded.variants}: \strong{Non-NULL only if} there are variants
that were excluded from the analysis. See the added extra column
\code{discarded.reason} for more details.
