\title{Create single nucleotide mutation catalog for *one* sample from
a Variant Call Format (VCF) file.}
\usage{
CreateOneColSNSCatalog(vcf, sample.id = "count")
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf}{An in-memory VCF file annotated by the AddSequence and
AddTranscript functions. It must *not* contain indels and must *not*
contain DNS (double nucleotide substitutions), or triplet base substitutions
etc., even if encoded as neighboring SNS.}

\item{sample.id}{Usually the sample id, but defaults to "count".}
