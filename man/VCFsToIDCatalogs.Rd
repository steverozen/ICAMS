\title{Create ID (small insertion and deletion) catalog from ID VCFs}
\usage{
VCFsToIDCatalogs(
  list.of.vcfs,
  ref.genome,
  region = "unknown",
  flag.mismatches = 0,
  return.annotated.vcfs = FALSE,
  suppress.discarded.variants.warnings = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{list.of.vcfs}{List of in-memory ID VCFs. The list names will be
the sample ids in the output catalog.}

\item{ref.genome}{A \code{ref.genome} argument as described in
\code{\link{ICAMS}}.}

\item{region}{A character string acting as a region identifier, one of
"genome", "exome".}

\item{flag.mismatches}{Deprecated. If there are ID variants whose \code{REF}
do not match the extracted sequence from \code{ref.genome}, the function
will automatically discard these variants and an element
\code{discarded.variants} will appear in the return value. See
\code{\link{AnnotateIDVCF}} for more details.}

\item{return.annotated.vcfs}{Logical. Whether to return the annotated VCFs
with additional columns showing mutation class for each variant. Default is
FALSE.}

\item{suppress.discarded.variants.warnings}{Logical. Whether to suppress
warning messages showing information about the discarded variants. Default
is TRUE.}
}
\description{
Create ID (small insertion and deletion) catalog from ID VCFs
}
\section{Value}{

A \strong{list} of elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{catalog}: The ID (small insertion and deletion) catalog with
attributes added. See \code{\link{as.catalog}} for details.
\item \code{discarded.variants}:
\strong{Non-NULL only if} there are ID variants that were discarded. A
list of data frames which contain the discarded variants from the original
VCF. The discarded variants can belong to the following categories:
\itemize{
\item Variants with the same number of bases for REF and ALT alleles.
\item Variants with empty REF or ALT alleles.
\item Complex indels.
\item Variants whose \code{REF} do not match the extracted sequence from
\code{ref.genome}.
\item Variants which cannot be categorized according to the canonical
representation. See catalog.row.order$ID for the canonical
representation.
}
\item \code{annotated.vcfs}:
\strong{Non-NULL only if} \code{return.annotated.vcfs} = TRUE. A list of
data frames which contain the original VCF's ID mutation rows with three
additional columns \code{seq.context.width}, \code{seq.context} and
\code{ID.class} added. The category assignment of each ID mutation in VCF can
be obtained from \code{ID.class} column.
}
}

\section{Note}{

In ID (small insertion and deletion) catalogs, deletion repeat sizes range
from 0 to 5+, but for plotting and end-user documentation deletion repeat
sizes range from 1 to 6+.

\section{ID classification}{

See
\url{https://github.com/steverozen/ICAMS/raw/master/data-raw/PCAWG7_indel_classification_2017_12_08.xlsx}
for additional information on ID (small insertion and deletion) mutation
classification.

See the documentation for \code{\link{Canonicalize1Del}} which first handles
deletions in homopolymers, then handles deletions in simple repeats with
longer repeat units, (e.g. \code{CACACACA}, see
\code{\link{FindMaxRepeatDel}}), and if the deletion is not in a simple
repeat, looks for microhomology (see \code{\link{FindDelMH}}).

See the code for unexported function \code{\link{CanonicalizeID}}
and the functions it calls for handling of insertions.
