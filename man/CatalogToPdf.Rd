}
\arguments{
\item{catalog}{A matrix whose rownames indicate the mutation types
while its columns contain the counts of each mutation type from
different samples.}

\item{name}{The name of the PDF file to be produced.}

\item{id}{A vector containing the ID information of different samples.}

\item{type}{A vector of values indicating the type of plot for each sample.
If type = "counts", the graph will plot the occurrences of the mutation
types in the sample. If type = "signature", the graph will plot mutation
signatures of the sample. If type = "density", the graph will plot the
rates of mutations per million nucleotides for each mutation type. (Please
take note there is no "density" type for CatIDtoPdf function and the option
of type = "density" is not implemented for function CatSNS192ToPdf,
CatSNS192StrandToPdf and CatDNS144ToPdf at the current stage.)}

\item{grid}{A logical value indicating whether to draw the grid lines in the
graph.}

\item{upper}{A logical value indicating whether to draw horizontal lines and
names of major mutation class on top of graph.}

\item{xlabels}{A logical value indicating whether to draw x axis labels.}

\item{abundance}{A matrix containing nucleotide abundance information, to
be used only when type = "density".}

\item{cex}{A numerical value giving the amount by which mutation class labels,
y axis labels, sample name and legend(if there exists) should be magnified
relative to the default.}

\description{
Plot the mutation catalog of different samples to a PDF file
}
\details{
\code{CatSNS96ToPdf} Plot the SNS 96 mutation catalog of different samples
to a PDF file.

\code{CatSNS192ToPdf} Plot the SNS 192 mutation catalog of different samples
to a PDF file.

\code{CatSNS192StrandToPdf} Plot the transcription strand bias graph of
6 SNS mutation types ("C>A", "C>G", "C>T", "T>A", "T>C", "T>G")
of different samples to a PDF file.

\code{CatSNS1536ToPdf} Plot the 1536 mutation catalog of >= 1 samples to a PDF
file. The mutation types are in six-letters like CATTAT, first 2-letters CA
refers to (-2, -1) position, third letter T refers to the base which has
mutation, next second 2-letters TA refers to (+1, +2) position, last letter T
refers to the base after mutation.

\code{CatDNS78ToPdf} Plot the DNS 78 mutation catalog of different samples
to a PDF file.

\code{CatDNS144ToPdf} Plot the transcription strand bias graph of
10 major DNS mutation types ("AC>NN", "AT>NN", "CC>NN", "CG>NN", "CT>NN",
"GC>NN", "TA>NN", "TC>NN", "TG>NN", "TT>NN") of different samples
to a PDF file.

\code{CatDNS136ToPdf} Plot the tetranucleotide sequence contexts of 10 major
DNS mutation types ("AC>NN", "AT>NN", "CC>NN", "CG>NN", "CT>NN", "GC>NN",
"TA>NN", "TC>NN", "TG>NN", "TT>NN") of different samples to a PDF file.

\code{CatIDToPdf} Plot the insertion and deletion catalog of different
samples to a PDF file. (Please take note that the deletions Repeat Size
ranges from 0 to 5+ in the catalog, but for plotting and end user
documentation it ranges from 1 to 6+.)
