GTF DUMP
--------

This directory includes a summary of the gene annotation information 
and GTF format.

Ensembl provides an automatic gene annotation for Homo sapiens.
For some species (including human, mouse, zebrafish and pig), the
annotation provided through Ensembl also includes manual annotation
from HAVANA.
These data will be dumped in a number of forms - one of them being 
GTF files. Our annotation is based on alignments of biological 
sequence data (eg. proteins, cDNAs) to the genome assembly. 
The annotation dumped here is transcribed and translated from the 
genome assembly and is not the original input sequence data that 
we used for alignment. Therefore, the sequences provided by Ensembl 
may differ from the original input sequence data where the genome 
assembly is different to the aligned sequence. 

GTF file format dumping provides all the annotated protein coding 
genes in this release genes's set. Considerably more information 
is stored in Ensembl: the GTF file just gives a representation which 
is compatible with existing tools.

--------------------------------
Definition and supported options
--------------------------------

The GFF (General Feature Format) format consists of one line per 
feature, each containing 9 columns of data, plus optional track 
definition lines. The following documentation is based on the 
Version 2 specifications. The GTF (General Transfer Format) is 
identical to GFF version 2.

Fields

Fields must be tab-separated. Also, all but the final field in each 
feature line must contain a value; "empty" columns should be denoted 
with a '.'

    seqname   - name of the chromosome or scaffold; chromosome names 
                can be given with or without the 'chr' prefix (the 
                convention in Ensembl is to omit the 'chr' prefix).
    source    - name of the program that generated this feature, or 
                the data source (database or project name)
    feature   - feature type name, e.g. Gene, Variation, Similarity
    start     - start position of the feature, with sequence numbering 
                starting at 1.
    end       - end position of the feature, with sequence numbering 
                starting at 1.
    score     - a floating point value.
    strand    - defined as + (forward) or - (reverse).
    frame     - one of '0', '1' or '2'. '0' indicates that the first 
                base of the feature is the first base of a codon, '1' 
                that the second base is the first base of a codon, and 
                so on..
    attribute - a semicolon-separated list of tag-value pairs, providing 
                additional information about each feature.

Track lines

Although not part of the formal GFF specification, Ensembl will use 
track lines to further configure sets of features. Track lines should 
be placed at the beginning of the list of features they are to affect.

The track line consists of the word 'track' followed by space-separated 
key=value pairs. Valid parameters used by Ensembl are:

    name        - unique name to identify this track when parsing the 
                  file
    description - Label to be displayed under the track in Region in 
                  Detail
    priority    - integer defining the order in which to display tracks, 
                  if multiple tracks are defined.
