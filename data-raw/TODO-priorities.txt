# ICAMS to do list, 2020 02 03

## Wait until after quarantine
User testing of ICAMS shiny app --- can the users manage the interface?

## Highest priority
Design and implement the following for the shiny app:
Add  to the "run_information" file the following: 
** Total mutation loads (per mutation type, SBSs, DBSs, etc)
** Strand bias statistics (need to calculate the stats):
    [ binom test for transcription strand bias (for 12 channel strand bias analysis)]

## High priority


... HICH Nanhai Add test of error reporting when user supplies incorrect ref.genome (ref.genome)
... HIGH Nanhai Extended sequence plotting for ID
... HIGH New arguments for PlotCatalog (allow graphics parameters, remove issues with labels in the wrong
    place depending on the mar graphics parameter.
... work with steve on background subtraction
... default sample input in shiny

## Steve
Steve Background signature subtraction (will take until late December)

## Medium priority
... MED Read and Write SigProfiler formated Indel catalogs (and check if 1536, 192, etc are 
    also different from PCAWG)
... MED HIGH Nanhai Extended sequence plotting for DNS 
... MED  Make a full transcriptional strand bias plot for DBS144 catalog.
Abandoned.... MED Plot transcription strand bias as function of distance from TSS
... MED Provide documentation on how row-names in catalogs encode mutations.
... MED Add error checking for cbinding catalogs with different attributes
... MED Update WriteCatalog() function to write the attributes of a catalog in the first few rows?
... MED	Update ReadCatalog() function to automatically read in the attributes of the input catalog based on the first few rows in the file? (allow exceptions for lacking first few rows, then requiring user input)
... MED Utility function to split VCF by VAF according to Arnoud? suggestion previously.
... MEDIUM Maybe: Should it be possible to supply a directory as input to
    StrelkaSBSVCFFilesToCatalogAndPlotToPDF and then take any VCF files in 
    the directory and put all the PDFs in that directory?
... MED Straned indel plot: see https://osf.io/2aj6t/wiki/4.%20Plotting%20Indels/ 
... MED Add Freebayes VCFs as an option in ICAMS (should be same Mutect except for VAF calculation) 

## Low priority
... LOW Should we create an intermediate catalog class that captures commonalties among all catalogs (e.g. the cbind and [ methods?)
... LOW More automatic tests for genomes that do not have built-in support
... LOW binomial tests for extended sequence context (e.g. enrichment of A 3 bp 5' of the mutation)
... LOW Function to filter VCF for homopolymers for human and mouse (consult w/ Mo, maybe make script)
... LOW For 1536, Put a legend to indicate the type of plotting? (counts, density, counts proportion, density proportion?)
... VERY LOW Read in MAF files
