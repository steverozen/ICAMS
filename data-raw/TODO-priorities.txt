# ICAMS to do list, 2019 06 18

## Highest priority

1.1 Steve assess feasibility of a shiny or other portable app / is web page easier?


## High priority
2.1 Nanhai Add built-in support for mouse mm10, create new transcript ranges and abundance files.
2.2 Steve Background signature subtraction
2.3 Nanhai binom test for transcription strand bias
2.4 Functions to re-write annotated VCFS
2.5 Corrections to extended sequence plotting for SBS
2.6 Extended sequence plotting for ID, DNS


## Medium priority3
3.1 Make a full transcriptional strand bias plot for DBS144 catalog.
3.2 Put a legend on the top right part of the graph to indicate the type of plotting? (counts, density, counts proportion, density proportion?)
3.3 Update as.catalog() function to ensure the catalog rows are in the expected order and have the expected row names?
3.4 Plot transcription strand bias as function of distance from TSS
3.5 Plot transcription strand bias as function of expression level
3.6 Function to filter VCF for homoplymers for human and mouse (consult w/ Mo, maybe make script)


## Low priority
4.1 Should we create an intermediate catalog class that captures commonalties among all catalogs (e.g. the cbind and [ methods?)
4.2 Update WriteCatalog() function to write the attributes of a catalog in the first few rows?
4.3	Update ReadCatalog() function to automatically read in the attributes of the input catalog based on the first few rows in the file?
4.4 Develop extended seq.context plotting functions for DBS and INDEL.
4.5 Should StrelkaSBSVCFFilesToCatalogAndPlotToPdf() and similar functions also save the catalogs to files?
4.6 Utility function to split VCF by VAF according to Arnoud? suggestion previously.
4.7 Add Freebayes VCFs as an option in ICAMS.
4.8 Update the legend in 1536 catalog plotting according to Liu Mo?s suggestion?
4.9 More automatic tests for genomes that do not have built-in support
4.10 binomial tests for extended sequence context (e.g. enrichment of A 3 bp 5' of the mutation)
4.11 Review Matas' comments on documentation


## Done

done 1.1 Nanhai Address CRAN comments
done 1.1.1 Nanhai Add examples to documentation (key functions only for now)
      Suggest to create an example for each, should be as simple as
      possible, then we can review again
done 1.1.2 Nanhai, other CRAN comments

done 1.2 Nanhai Checks for functions ReadAndSplitStrelkaSBSVCFs(), ReadStrelkaIDVCFs() according to Arnoud?s suggestion in the email.

done 1.3 Nanhai Change the PPM plot functions according to Arnoud? suggestion in the email.
