Title: In-depth Characterization and Analysis of Mutational Signatures
Version: 0.0.0.9002
Author: Steve Rozen, Nanhai Jiang, Arnoud Boot
Maintainer: Steve Rozen <steverozen@gmail.com>
Description: This package has functions to read in VCF files from Strelka and 
    Mutect (in the Broad GATK package), create, read, and write SNS, DNS, ID 
    catalogs and do different types of plotting.
    This alpha version only works with VCFs for human GRCh37, but will work for
    arbitrary human catalogs (assuming no major change in "opportunities"
    between GRCh37 and GRCh38).
