Title: In-depth Characterization and Analysis of Mutational Signatures
Version: 2.0.0.9005
Author: Steve Rozen, Nanhai Jiang, Arnoud Boot, Mo Liu
Maintainer: Steve Rozen <steverozen@gmail.com>
Description: Analysis and visualization of experimentally elucidated mutational
    signatures -- the kind of analysis and visualization in Boot et al.,
    "In-depth characterization of the cisplatin mutational signature in 
    human cell lines and in esophageal and liver tumors", 2018, 
    <https://genome.cshlp.org/content/28/5/654.short>. ICAMS has functions 
    to read in variant call files (VCFs) and to collate the corresponding
    catalogs of mutational spectra and to analyze and plot catalogs of 
    mutational spectra and signatures. Handles both "counts-based" and
    "density-based" catalogs of mutational spectra or signatures.
